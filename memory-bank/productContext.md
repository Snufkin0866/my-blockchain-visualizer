# Blockchain Transaction Visualizer - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

The Blockchain Transaction Visualizer was created to address the challenge of understanding complex transaction relationships on blockchain networks. While blockchain data is publicly available, it's often difficult to interpret and visualize the flow of funds between addresses. This tool bridges the gap between raw blockchain data and meaningful insights by providing intuitive visualizations and analysis capabilities.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Data Accessibility**: Raw blockchain data is publicly available but difficult to access and interpret without technical knowledge. This tool provides a user-friendly interface to access and understand this data.

2. **Relationship Visualization**: Understanding the relationships between blockchain addresses is challenging when looking at raw transaction data. The network visualization feature makes these relationships clear and intuitive.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in transaction behavior over time is difficult without proper visualization tools. The time-series analysis features help users identify trends and anomalies.

4. **Cross-Blockchain Analysis**: Comparing transaction patterns across different blockchains (Bitcoin and Ethereum) requires using multiple tools and APIs. This project unifies the experience across blockchains.

5. **Technical Barriers**: Many existing blockchain explorers are designed for technical users. This tool aims to be accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## How It Should Work

### User Flow

1. **Search**: Users enter a blockchain address (Bitcoin or Ethereum) to begin their exploration.

2. **Transaction List**: The system retrieves and displays a list of transactions associated with the address, with options to filter by date range.

3. **Network Visualization**: Users can view a network graph showing the relationships between the searched address and other addresses it has transacted with.

4. **Depth Exploration**: Users can adjust the "depth" of exploration to see transactions further removed from the original address (e.g., transactions of addresses that transacted with the searched address).

5. **Time Analysis**: Users can analyze how transaction patterns change over time using the time-series visualization features.

### Technical Flow

1. **API Integration**: The backend connects to BlockCypher and Etherscan APIs to retrieve blockchain data.

2. **Data Processing**: The system processes and normalizes data from different blockchains into a consistent format.

3. **Database Storage**: Processed data is stored in a database for efficient retrieval and to minimize API calls.

4. **Visualization Rendering**: The frontend renders network graphs and time-series visualizations based on the processed data.

5. **User Interaction**: The system responds to user interactions (filtering, depth adjustments, etc.) by updating visualizations accordingly.

## User Experience Goals

1. **Intuitive Interface**: Users should be able to navigate and use the tool without extensive blockchain knowledge.

2. **Responsive Design**: The interface should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Clear Visualizations**: Network graphs and time-series visualizations should be clear, informative, and not overwhelming.

4. **Performance**: Data retrieval and visualization rendering should be fast enough to maintain user engagement.

5. **Error Handling**: The system should gracefully handle API limitations, invalid addresses, and other potential errors.

6. **Multilingual Support**: The interface should support multiple languages, with initial focus on Japanese and English.

7. **Educational Value**: The tool should help users learn about blockchain transaction patterns through exploration.
