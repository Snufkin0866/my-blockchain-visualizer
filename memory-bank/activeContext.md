# Blockchain Transaction Visualizer - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current development focus is on enhancing the transaction visualization capabilities and improving the user experience for exploring blockchain transaction networks. Specifically, we are working on:

1. **Depth-based transaction exploration**: Implementing the ability to explore transaction networks at varying depths from a starting address
2. **Performance optimization**: Improving the loading and rendering performance for large transaction networks
3. **User interface enhancements**: Making the visualization controls more intuitive and responsive

## Recent Changes

### Backend

1. **Depth Migration**: Added a `fetch_depth` column to the transaction database schema to track how deep in the network each transaction was discovered
   - Implementation in `backend/app/database/add_fetch_depth_column.py`
   - Documentation in `backend/app/database/README_DEPTH_MIGRATION.md`

2. **API Enhancements**: 
   - Improved error handling for blockchain API rate limits
   - Added pagination support for transaction lists
   - Implemented caching mechanisms to reduce external API calls

3. **Blockchain Adapters**:
   - Refactored the blockchain adapter classes to support depth-based exploration
   - Enhanced the Ethereum adapter to handle complex contract interactions

### Frontend

1. **Network Visualization**:
   - Updated the D3.js network graph to support zooming and panning
   - Added color coding for transaction directions (incoming/outgoing)
   - Implemented tooltips for transaction details on hover

2. **Transaction Explorer**:
   - Enhanced the transaction search form with validation and auto-suggestions
   - Improved the transaction list component with sorting and filtering options
   - Added transaction statistics summary component

3. **UI/UX Improvements**:
   - Implemented responsive design for mobile compatibility
   - Added loading indicators for API requests
   - Enhanced error messaging for user feedback

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Complete depth control implementation**:
   - Add UI controls for adjusting exploration depth
   - Update backend to respect depth parameter in all API calls
   - Optimize database queries for depth-limited searches

2. **Enhance visualization performance**:
   - Implement data sampling for large networks
   - Add progressive loading for network visualization
   - Optimize D3.js rendering for complex networks

3. **Improve transaction details view**:
   - Add more detailed transaction information
   - Implement transaction grouping by address
   - Add ability to export transaction data

### Medium-term Goals

1. **Time-series visualization**:
   - Implement timeline view of transactions
   - Add filters for date ranges
   - Visualize transaction volume over time

2. **Enhanced search capabilities**:
   - Add advanced search options (amount, date, transaction type)
   - Implement saved searches functionality
   - Add batch address search

3. **Documentation and tutorials**:
   - Create user guides for common use cases
   - Add tooltips and help text throughout the interface
   - Implement interactive tutorials for new users

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Depth Limitation Strategy**:
   - Current approach: Hard limit depth to 3 levels to prevent performance issues
   - Alternative being considered: Dynamic depth based on address transaction volume
   - Decision pending: Performance testing with large transaction sets

2. **Visualization Rendering**:
   - Current approach: D3.js force-directed graph with SVG rendering
   - Alternative being considered: WebGL rendering for larger networks
   - Decision pending: Performance comparison on complex networks

3. **Data Caching Strategy**:
   - Current approach: Database caching with time-based invalidation
   - Alternative being considered: Redis caching layer for frequently accessed data
   - Decision pending: Evaluation of database query performance

### UX Considerations

1. **Network Graph Interaction**:
   - How to make complex network interactions intuitive for non-technical users
   - Finding the right balance between information density and clarity
   - Determining the most useful default visualization settings

2. **Search Experience**:
   - Simplifying the process of finding relevant transactions
   - Providing meaningful feedback for invalid addresses or API limitations
   - Balancing between simple and advanced search options

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - Adapting complex network visualizations for smaller screens
   - Ensuring touch interactions work well for graph exploration
   - Optimizing performance for mobile devices

## Current Challenges

1. **API Rate Limits**:
   - Working within the constraints of free-tier API limits
   - Implementing efficient caching and request batching
   - Providing meaningful user feedback when limits are reached

2. **Large Network Visualization**:
   - Handling addresses with thousands of transactions
   - Maintaining interactive performance with complex graphs
   - Presenting large datasets in a meaningful way

3. **Cross-Blockchain Consistency**:
   - Normalizing data formats between Bitcoin and Ethereum
   - Handling blockchain-specific transaction types
   - Providing consistent user experience across different blockchains
