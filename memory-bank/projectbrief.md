# Blockchain Transaction Visualizer - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Blockchain Transaction Visualizer is a tool designed to visualize and analyze transaction flows between addresses on Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. It provides users with the ability to search for transactions by wallet address, visualize network relationships between addresses, and analyze transaction patterns over time.

## Core Requirements

1. **Transaction Search and Retrieval**
   - Search for transactions by wallet address
   - Retrieve transaction history for specified addresses
   - Filter transactions by date range

2. **Network Visualization**
   - Visualize address relationships as a network graph
   - Show transaction flows between addresses
   - Support for both Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains

3. **Time-Series Analysis**
   - Analyze transaction patterns over specified time periods
   - Track changes in transaction relationships

4. **Data Storage and Management**
   - Store transaction data in a database for efficient retrieval
   - Manage API rate limits for blockchain data providers

## Technical Goals

1. Create a responsive and intuitive user interface
2. Implement efficient data retrieval from blockchain APIs
3. Develop clear and informative network visualizations
4. Ensure proper error handling for API limitations and failures
5. Support multilingual interface (currently Japanese and English)

## Target Users

- Blockchain researchers
- Cryptocurrency analysts
- Financial investigators
- Blockchain enthusiasts
- Educational institutions studying blockchain networks

## Success Criteria

1. Users can successfully search and retrieve transaction data for any valid address
2. Network visualizations clearly show relationships between addresses
3. Time-series analysis provides meaningful insights into transaction patterns
4. System handles API rate limits and errors gracefully
5. Interface is intuitive and responsive across devices

## Constraints

1. API rate limits from BlockCypher and Etherscan
2. Data volume limitations for large address networks
3. Visualization complexity for addresses with many transactions
4. Performance considerations for real-time network rendering
